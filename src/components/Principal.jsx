            society and nation as a whole. We believe that the purpose of

            aspirations and adequate competence to actualize it. Since its
            establishment in 2009, the institute has made its presence strongly
            felt in the technical education community not only in the region but
            at state level too. A range of achievement in academics in all six
            branches is attained by joint efforts of all stake holders. Our very
            young alumni continue to keep the institute name high.
